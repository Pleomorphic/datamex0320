I am Victor Alan, I was born in Mexico,but left to the Usa as a baby, I am currently a part time student and part time worker. I have some experience with tech/data. I cam here to challenge myself and to reach new hights in the tech world. A good friend told me about Iron hack, I expect to learn more about data and how to manipulate the info with code. I am thinking on finishing a project on data analitics, and seek data analitics employment. I see myself as an entrepenuer and a founder of a future app.
